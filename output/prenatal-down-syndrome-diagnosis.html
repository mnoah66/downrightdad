<p>I remember uttering confidently to my wife that if we had a child with Down Syndrome it wouldn’t be a big deal.  After all, I had worked with individuals with Down Syndrome for most of my adult life, and she had worked with some children in the Special Education department at her school.  We knew a lot of the expectations and how to access services as our baby grew older.  We were pretty casual about the whole thing, mostly optimistic and excited about the pregnancy and future altogether. But that was on the drive home from a blood draw for the MaterniT21 test.  A few weeks later, however, was an entirely different story.</p>
<p>We received the call on a Friday in April that the MaterniT21 test was positive, and it was almost a sure thing our baby girl would have Down Syndrome.  Despite our optimism and nonchalant-ness about the whole thing, the news was devastating.  We cried, we embraced, and cried some more.  When the tears subdued, disbelief set in.  We furiously researched stories similar to ours and grasped at every false positive story we found.  But eventually, reality and rationality set in.  With every doctor’s appointment, a new Down Syndrome marker was discovered, along with the awkward--and unfortunate--encounters with medical professionals. I couldn’t make every appointment, but enough to surmise the deficit doctors have in dealing with these issues.  Each encounter was that of condolence, not spoken but implied, through body language and consoling behavior.  We really could’ve used a spark of positivity and brightness that we know now.</p>
<p>Words cannot describe what we went through with the prenatal diagnosis.  The feelings I had I regret having and wish I could take back, but I guess that’s all a part of the journey of surrender and acceptance. Finley is six months old and now I understand what everyone said about having a child with Down Syndrome.  That they are a blessing, that we will love this child like any other, that they are a special gift only given to special couples.  Our love for Finley is a special kind of love.  It’s almost as if we love Finley more because she has Down Syndrome, and there’s really no explaining that.  And to this day, I am still in disbelief of how it’s possible to love something or someone this much.</p>
