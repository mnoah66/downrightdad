We had just picked up Finley from an afternoon nap when she had what seemed like a startle reflex.  Waking up from a nap, this seemed totally usual and nothing out of the ordinary.  A day later, it continued.  Two days later, her eyes started rolling into the back of her head and they were more frequent.  Alarmed, we called the pediatrician and brought her in right away and were referred to see a neurologist as soon as possible.  A few days later we were admitted to the hospital and hooked up to a video EEG.

After nearly three days of having the video EEG running, the neurologist confirmed that Finley had Infantile Spasms.  Her EEG showed "hypsarrythmias" which are "...very chaotic and disorganized brain electrical activity with no recognizable pattern..."

The hospital reviewed some of the treatment options with us.  One of them being [Adrenocorticotropic hormone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenocorticotropic_hormone "Wikipedia - Adrenocorticotropic hormone") and then some seizure medications like Topamax and Vigabatrin.  The ACTH is the preffered treatment, but patients must be healthy during the treatment.  And as misfortunate would have it, Finley also happened to have Pneumonia.  After a week in the hospital recovering from Pneumonia, we were sent home with antibiotics to fight off the last of the infection.  A week or so later we planned to return to the hospital to begin the ACTH.  Seeing Finley continue to have the spasms while we just had to play the waiting game was devastating, but the doctors painted a vivid picture: infections are deadly, the spasms were not.

##Day 1

We checked into the hospital late in the morning.  An hour or so later, Finley received her first injection of ACTH, and the training for us began.  We learned how to draw the medication into syringes, measure, clean, and inject.  Finley had a normal amount of clusters of spasms that day.

## Day 2

The injections continued, twice daily in the morning and evening.  Side effects were monitored, and training continued.  Finley had two clusters of spasms that day.

## Day 6

I'm on the verge of tears as I write this.  After three days of no spasms (at least that we could observe), Finley had an episode in the early morning&mdash;on a Saturday, no less.  We immediatey called the on-call line at the neurologist's office.  By the time he called back, our panic had settled, but we were still concerned and confused.  The doctor said it was possible for Finley to continue to have clusters of spasms during the treatment, and to keep in touch if she continued to have them that day.  What was especially alarming for us was that her cluster of spasms this morning were not typical, and it almost looked like an entirely different spasm or seizure altogether.  There was no body wrenching, just eye rolling, crying, and an upwards gaze of her eyes.  The upwards gaze continued throughout the day, and we furiously connected to others on social media to see if they also had a relapse during the course of the ACTH treatment. Indeed, they did.  Many stories we came across saw some positive effects of ACTH, only to have the spasms re-appear and lead to introduction of other medications, particularly vigabatrin.  Many people also said that the effects of ACTH are not truly judged until two weeks of a high dosage. Considering we're at day six, we still have some time to go...

It's alsmot as if we're back to square one.  But at least this time around, we have direction and knowledge.  We continue to be optimisitc that our little angel will recover and grace us again with her beautiful smile and personality!

## Day 7 - 20

Aside from the setback on day 6, it was relatively smooth sailing for Finley.  On day 15 we began weaning down the ACTH dosage, and after a few days Finley blessed us with her smile and giggles again!  During the treatment and weaning, Finley would do some grunting and flexing of her right arm, bringing her right forearm up to her mouth and grunting as if she was going number 2.  As the days went on, she slowed down with the grunting and such, but it was becoming difficult again to rouse a smile out of her.

## Day 29

Today we gave Finley her very last dose of ACTH, 0.04ml.  What a relief!  After 30 days of injecting a needle into our baby, it became routine and the trauma (for us!) wore off, but it was still a joy knowing we wouldn't have to stick her chunky little thighs again.  Later that day, we saw the neurologist for a follow-up appointment. A week or two prior, Finley had a 40 minute EEG.  There was good news and bad; the hypsarrythmic behavior all but resolved, but there was still "slowing" and "focal irritability" of her left temporal lobe.  After numerous questions, we were on our way home with another EEG order, and an MRI.

## Days 30+ish

Well, the "firsts" continue!  Finley had her first MRI under general anesthesia and the next day was hooked up to an EEG that we could thankfully bring home with us.  A few days later, we received the good news: a normal EEG!  üòÅ

The MRI showed a micro-bleed which occurred during pregnancy and was the source of the focal irritability from the previous EEG.  The doctor is still looking into that, as it is depositing iron in that section of her brain. But we have a follow-up soon to discuss that more in-depth and we can begin talking about taking her off her seizure medication (Topamax)
