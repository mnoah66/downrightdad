We had just picked up Finley from an afternoon nap when she had what seemed like a startle reflex.  Waking up from a nap, this seemed totally usual and nothing out of the ordinary.  A day later, it continued.  Two days later, her eyes started rolling into the back of her head and they were more frequent.  Alarmed, we called the pediatrician and brought her in right away and were referred to see a neurologist as soon as possible.  A few days later we were admitted to the hospital and hooked up to a video EEG.

After nearly three days of having the video EEG running, the neurologist confirmed that Finley had Infantile Spasms.  Her EEG showed "hypsarrythmias" which are "...very chaotic and disorganized brain electrical activity with no recognizable pattern..."

The hospital reviewed some of the treatment options with us.  One of them being [Adrenocorticotropic hormone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenocorticotropic_hormone "Wikipedia - Adrenocorticotropic hormone") and then some seizure medications like Topamax and Vigabatrin.  The ACTH is the preffered treatment, but patients must be healthy during the treatment.  And as misfortunate would have it, Finley also happened to have Pneumonia.  After a week in the hospital recovering from Pneumonia, we were sent home with antibiotics to fight off the last of the infection.  A week or so later we planned to return to the hospital to begin the ACTH.  Seeing Finley continue to have the spasms while we just had to play the waiting game was devastating, but the doctors painted a vivid picture: infections are deadly, the spasms were not.

##Day 1

We checked into the hospital late in the morning.  An hour or so later, Finley received her first injection of ACTH, and the training for us began.  We learned how to draw the medication into syringes, measure, clean, and inject.  Finley had a normal amount of spasms that day.

## Day 2

The injections continued, twice daily in the morning and evening.  Side effects were monitored, and training continued.  Finley had two spasms that day.
