# Am I exploiting my daugthers diagnosis?

Before Finley was born, I had only encountered a few examples of parents either blogging about their special needs children, promoting some advocacy group, or posting pictures on Instagram.  Struggling with the prenatal diagnosis, I didn't really want to seek out these accounts and I turned a blind eye to the beauty and joy a child with DS would bring.

After Finley was born, I kind of made a promise to myself that I'd never exploit her disability.  I didn't want to put Finley on a pedestal and show her off only because she had DS.  And yet that's exactly what I did!  Why the change of heart?  After finding a few amazing accounts on Instagram, I realized it is anything but exploitation.  Granted, our experience with Infantile Spasms naturally led us to seek out *just about everything we could find on the internet, including blogs and hashtags on social media*. But the online DS community is incredible.  From fashion to milestones, spasms to sign language, it is amazing to see the unique journeys of other little ones with DS. Besides the joy and comraderie, there's also awareness.  This blog and my Instragram account are most likely an introduction to DS and developmental disabilities for a lot of my family and friends and of course it's a way for others to connect.  Being a dad also puts a different twist on things as most of the accounts and blogs out there are run by moms.  Obviously, we still have a ways to go with awareness and eroding the stereotypes and vile discourse out there.  Case in point, type in '#DownSydrome' into an Instagram search and you'll see one of the top results is #Downsyndromememes with, at the time of this writing, 31k posts...ðŸ˜ 

I can understand the interesting relatonship between awareness and normalization.  Parents with special needs children want to raise awareness about the diagnosis, and yet we also want our children's upbringing and every life experience to be normal.  We want our children treated just like any other child would be treated.  Yet, parents of children without disabilities are not creating Instagram accounts for them, and those with disabilities are broadcasting it out to the world.
