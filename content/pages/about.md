Hi!  I'm Martin and I started this blog as a way to document my journey of fatherhood and being a parent.  Many blogs out there are written by mothers and I thought that maybe there are some dad's out there that would like to follow things from the perspective of other fathers, especially those special fathers with special needs children.

I hope you enjoy reading!
